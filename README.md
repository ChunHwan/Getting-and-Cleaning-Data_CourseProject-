# Getting and Cleaning Data - CourseProject

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Project Summary
create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Data Source 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Output Files 
1. run_analysis.R : It contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
2. tidydata.txt. : The output file that is made by performing the 5th step of run_analysis.R above
3. readme.md : It should explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
4. CodeBook.md : It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
